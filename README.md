Title: Predicting Cancer Mortality Rates using Machine Learning

Description: This is a machine learning project that uses data on cancer mortality rates in the United States to predict the mortality rate for a given county. The project uses Python and the scikit-learn library to build a linear regression model that predicts the mortality rate based on several features such as cancer incidence, poverty rate, and unemployment rate.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and it contains information on cancer mortality rates for 3,142 counties in the United States. The data is preprocessed and analyzed using Pandas and Seaborn libraries in Python.

The linear regression model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on the remaining portion using mean squared error. The model is then deployed to make predictions on new data.

This project is a great example of how machine learning can be used to predict important health outcomes, and the code can be easily adapted to other similar datasets. The project is open-source and available on GitHub for anyone to use and contribute to.
